**Overview**
I analysed multiple csv files to provide recommendations for Microsoft to produce their own films.
**Business Problem**
Microsoft may be able to increase their chances of movie office success by investing in studios that have comparable attributes to recent popular releases.

My analyses were based by the following questions:

1. Which studio produced the most number of movies?
2. How were the budgets of particular movies spread?
3. How were the sales distributed in various years?

**Data**
Data for this analysis is from 3 files:
1. 'bom.movie_gross.csv' - This csv file contains a dataset with 3387 rows and 5 columns with foreign and domestic gross sales. 
2. 'tmdb.movies.csv' - This file contains movie titles and their popularity and ratings
3. 'tn.movie_budgets' - This file contains budgets and sales particular movies made in various years

**Results**
1. From analysis, 2018 made the highest sales compared to previous years while both 2011 and 2015 made the least

2. From analysis, Universal Studios produced the most movie titles than any other prouction studio
3. From analysis, movie titles that had high budgets prove to make the highest sales

**Conclusion**
- Collaboration and Partnerships:  Forming strategic partnerships can facilitate access to talent, resources, and distribution channels, increasing the chances of success for Microsoft's films. If Microsoft is looking into collaborating with a studio, they should consider Universal Studios because they have created the most number of movie titles compared to other studios

- Have high budgets to invest in high-quality production: Focus on producing films with high production values, compelling storytelling, and engaging visuals. A strong emphasis on quality will help differentiate Microsoft's films from competitors and attract discerning moviegoers. High budgeted movies tend to bring high sales
