# Microsoft's Movie Analysis

**Overview**
I analyzed 3 CSV files to provide Microsoft with recommendations for producing their own films
**Business Problem**
Microsoft may be able to increase their chances of movie office success by investing in films that have comparable attributes to recent popular releases. Our analyses were guided by the following questions:
1. How were the sales distributed in particular years
2. Which studio made the most movie titles

**Data**
I used data form the following csf files
1. 'bom.movie_gross.csv' - This file has 3387 rows and 5 rows of data. They contain title names foreign and domestic gross sales in particular years
2. 'tmdb.movies.csv' - This file contains a list of mvie titles with its popularity given by fans
3. 'tn.movie_budgets' - This file contains movie titles with its correspondent budgets and sales it made worldwide
**Results**
1. From analysis, 2018 made the highest sales compared to previous years while both 2011 and 2015 made the least
2. From analysis, Universal studios created the most number of movie titles compared to any other production studio
3. From analysis, movies with the highest production budgets made the most sales world wide

**Conclusion**
- Collaboration and Partnerships:  Forming strategic partnerships can facilitate access to talent, resources, and distribution channels, increasing the chances of success for Microsoft's films. If Microsoft is looking into collaborating with a studio, they should consider Universal Studios because they have created the most number of movie titles compared to other studios
- Have high budgets to invest in high-quality production: Focus on producing films with high production values, compelling storytelling, and engaging visuals. A strong emphasis on quality will help differentiate Microsoft's films from competitors and attract discerning moviegoers. High budgeted movies tend to bring high sales
